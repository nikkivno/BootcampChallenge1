# Horiseon Webpage Update/Bootcamp Challenge #1


## Project Description
```
The updates to this web page have been made to enhance accessibility. The application was edited using Visual Studio Code and pushed to the internet by Github. 

The changes to this application are as follows:
- A title has been added to the webpage to show users what they are viewing in the tab
- The use of the <div> tag has been replaced by semantic HTML elements (ex. section, nav, and article)
-The link from 'Search Engine Optimization' in the <nav> tag now works to take the user to the SEO blurb further down the page
- Alt attributes have been added to all applicable images to help aid in accessibility for screen readers
- Heading attributes have been edited to fall sequentially to align with the flow of the webpage
- CSS elements have been minimally modified to create a more streamlined reading experience for other developers
```
